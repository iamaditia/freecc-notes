// Basic Data Structures
/*
Data can be stored and accessed in many ways.
You already know some common JavaScript data structures â€” arrays and objects.

In this Basic Data Structures course, you'll learn more about the differences between arrays and objects,
and which to use in different situations.
You'll also learn how to use helpful JS methods like splice() and Object.keys() to access and manipulate data.
*/

// 8. Copy an Array with the Spread Operator
/*
We have defined a function, copyMachine which takes arr (an array) and num (a number) as arguments.
The function is supposed to return a new array made up of num copies of arr.
We have done most of the work for you, but it doesn't work quite right yet.
Modify the function using spread syntax so that it works correctly
(hint: another method we have already covered might come in handy here!).
*/

function copyMachine(arr, num) {
  let newArr = [];
  while (num >= 1) {
    // Only change code below this line
    newArr.unshift([...arr]);
    // Only change code above this line
    num--;
  }
  return newArr;
}

console.log(copyMachine([true, false, true], 2));

// 9. Combine Arrays with the Spread Operator
/*
We have defined a function spreadOut that returns the variable sentence.
Modify the function using the spread operator
so that it returns the array ['learning', 'to', 'code', 'is', 'fun'].
*/

function spreadOut() {
  let fragment = ['to', 'code'];
  let sentence = ['learning', ...fragment, 'is', 'fun'];; // Change this line
  return sentence;
}

console.log(spreadOut());

// 10. Check For The Presence of an Element With indexOf()
/*
indexOf() can be incredibly useful for
quickly checking for the presence of an element on an array.
We have defined a function, quickCheck, that takes an array and an element as arguments.
Modify the function using indexOf() so
that it returns true if the passed element exists on the array,
and false if it does not.
*/

function quickCheck(arr, elem) {
  // Only change code below this line
  if (arr.indexOf(elem) != -1) {
    return true;
  } else {
    return false;
  }
  // Only change code above this line
}

console.log(quickCheck(['squash', 'onions', 'shallots'], 'mushrooms'));

// 11. Iterate Through All an Array's Items Using For Loops
// Instruction:
/*
We have defined a function, filteredArray,
which takes arr, a nested array, and elem as arguments,
and returns a new array. elem represents an element that may or may not be present
on one or more of the arrays nested within arr.
Modify the function, using a for loop, to return a filtered version of the passed array
such that any array nested within arr containing elem has been removed.
*/

function filteredArray(arr, elem) {
  let newArr = [];
  // Only change code below this line
  for (let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
      if (arr[i].indexOf(elem) == -1) {
        newArr.push(arr[i]);
    }
  }
  // Only change code above this line
  return newArr;
}

console.log(filteredArray([[3, 2, 3], [1, 6, 3], [3, 13, 26], [19, 3, 9]], 3));

// 12. Create complex multi-dimensional arrays
/*
We have defined a variable, myNestedArray, set equal to an array.
Modify myNestedArray, using any combination of strings, numbers, and booleans for data elements,
so that it has exactly five levels of depth (remember, the outer-most array is level 1).
Somewhere on the third level, include the string deep, on the fourth level, include the string deeper,
and on the fifth level, include the string deepest.
*/

let myNestedArray = [
  // Only change code below this line
  ['unshift', false, 1, 2, 3, 'complex', 'nested'],

// 13. Add Key-Value Pairs to JavaScript Objects
/*

grapes with a value of 35, and strawberries with a value of 27.

Here we've defined an object userActivity, which includes another object nested within it.

// 15. Access Property Names with Bracket Notation
/*
We've defined a function, checkInventory, which receives a scanned item as an argument.
Return the current value of the scannedItem key in the foods object.
You can assume that only valid keys will be provided as an argument to checkInventory.

/*
Use the delete keyword to remove the oranges, plums, and strawberries keys from the foods object.
*/

  oranges: 32,

/*
We've defined a function countOnline which accepts one argument (a users object).
Use a for...in statement within this function to loop through the users object
passed into the function and return the number of users whose online property is set to true.
An example of a users object which could be passed to countOnline is shown below.
Each user will have an online property with either a true or false value.

/*
Take a look at the object we've provided in the code editor.
The user object contains three keys.
The data key contains five keys, one of which contains an array of friends.
From this, you can see how flexible objects are as data structures.
We've started writing a function addFriend.
Finish writing it so that it takes a user object and adds the name of the friend argument
to the array stored in user.data.friends and returns that array.
